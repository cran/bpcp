Simulation2013     Does most of Simulations for Fay, Brittain, Proschan (2013, Biostatistics, 723-736) (except unconstrained bootstrap). Actual simulations took over a week to run. See code to set number of reps.
SimulationBootOnly2013     Does Unconstrained bootstrap Simulation for Fay, Brittain, Proschan (2013). Requested by reviewer, and done after initial submission. 
NotesMMandMC       Script for producing the figures in the Notes on method of moments and Monte carlo methods for calculating BPCP.
Simulation2015     Simulations for Fay Brittain (2015, unpublished), which used monotonic option and included mid-p version. Took several days to run.
