Description: Calculates nonparametric pointwise confidence intervals for the survival distribution for right censored data, and for medians [Fay and Brittain <doi:10.1002/sim.6905>]. Has two-sample tests for dissimilarity (e.g., difference, ratio or odds ratio) in survival at a fixed time, and differences in medians [Fay, Proschan, and Brittain <doi:10.1111/biom.12231>]. Especially important for latter parts of the survival curve, small sample sizes or heavily censored data. Includes mid-p options.
