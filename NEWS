CHANGES in `bpcp' VERSION 1.1-0
- modify output for bpcp so that it outputs beta parameters associated with method of moments implementation. 
  This is needed for testing at fixed time points in the two sample case using the bpcp2samp function.
- create bpcp2samp function for the two sample test for differences at a fixed time point using the confidence distribution approach.
- create fixtdiff function for the two sample test for differences at a fixed time point using asyptotic normal approximations
-create mdiffmedian.test function for the two sample test for differences in medians (with no censoring)
- edit help for kmciLR and kmci objects.
- add conf.level for output to kmciLR objects

CHANGES in `bpcp' VERSION 1.0-0
- add kmtestBoot, unconstrained Bootstrap
- add SimulationBootOnly to demo. 
- minor edits of help pages (e.g., update reference)
